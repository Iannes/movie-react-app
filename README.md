## Movie DB Search

The app consumes the [Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to retrieve movies.

Users type in a movie and get all relevant results displayed on the page.

To install, head to the root of the project on your terminal and run either `yarn` or `npm i`.

To fire up the server run `yarn start` or `npm run start`.

### Movie Database Api Key

```
In order for the app to work, you will need an API key. After you set up the key, all you need to do is create a .env.development file at the root of the project and store the key under the variable name REACT_APP_API_KEY. To read more on how to register for an api key, click [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api).
```

### Todos

- Add logic for elements that return with no images, title, description etc.
- Use Netlify to deploy when finished.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
